# Ethereum Token Swap

### How it works

- the UI connects to MetaMask and gets your xGRAM and TON balances
- when you click 'Swap' this triggers a smart contract that takes care of the swap
- the smart contract burns your futures tokens and sends you the new ones

### Requirements

- `truffle`
- `ganache-cli`
- `MetaMask` pointing to Ganache

### Installation

- `npm i`
- `cd client`
- `yarn`

### Running the tool

- run `ganache-cli -i 1337 -d`
- copy the second account generated by Ganache and import it to MetaMask
- run `truffle migrate` in the main directory
- run `yarn start` in the `client` directory
- hopefully the app will run and you will see a non-zero xGRAM balance
- click swap and watch the magic happen
